    <p>
    The last department store standing at Valley View Mall made its tired exit last week with barely a
    dying gasp. It was a quiet death.
    </p><p>
    There wasn't much to see in those final fire-sale days, just a few clusters of leftovers heaped
    together in the cavernous, empty store: some pipe wrenches; odd pieces of patio furniture; a rack
    of garish ties; bulk packages of discount underpants. The few shoppers poking around looked
    understandably disillusioned.
    </p><p>
    Valley View itself has been on life support for years, yet it has fared better than many of its
    cookie-cutter contemporaries. Its robust location — North Dallas, but not the suburbs — created
    the incentive for what will be a phoenix-like rebirth, when the property is repurposed as Dallas
    Midtown, an updated-and-urbanized vision of the mixed-use development.
    </p><p>
    Even in its waning years, it fared better than countless malls of identical genesis and layout,
    eking out a few years of afterlife as an artists' cooperative.
    </p><p>
    Last week, though, it was just another dead mall, another dinosaur carcass. It had the gloomy
    feel of a lost civilization, like the movie set from the original Planet of the Apes. I was Charlton
    Heston.
    </p><p>
    Malls died a long and painful death precisely because of their wasteful ubiquity; no species so
    prolific could be wiped out overnight. The mall was everywhere, as boring and outdated as the
    rumpus room in your parents' basement. Americans grew cynical about the notion of recreational
    shopping (although it did, and still does, occupy much of our attention).
    </p><p>
    In all honesty, it had been so long since I visited a mall that touring Valley View's skeletal
    remains was a nostalgic novelty. Viewed from the floor above, the abandoned food court was
    littered with debris, the trophy-sized tropical plants dead from lack of water.
    </p><p>
    I could see the ghost of my teenage self there, snickering with friends over Styrofoam plates of
    sticky lo mein, showing off our hideous purchases — tacky blouses, evil-smelling perfume, cheap
    costume jewelry. Oh, to be young, your babysitting earnings burning a hole in your bell-bottomed
    Levis.
    </p><p>
    Valley View was full of such ghosts, but not much else. Most of the storefronts were empty
    anonymous spaces, fenced off behind pull-down gates. A few showed the heroic efforts of re-
    purpose schemes: Art galleries, craft shops, an odd World War II exhibit.
    </p><p>
    The latter consisted almost entirely of mannequins dressed in authentic uniforms of both the
    Allied and Axis powers standing in a crowded space that used to house a sporting goods store, a
    macabre gathering of enemies. The chain-link gate gave it the feel of a POW camp scene. A
    Luftwaffe officer cradled his own head beneath one arm: A joke?
    </p><p>
    I am as soppy and nostalgic as the next person; probably more so than most. It hurts to see
    architectural milestones from my own lifetime knocked down and reincarnated with the dinosaur
    carcasses of the future: Starbucks, Apple stores, pseudo-minimalist bars and restaurants with
    "craft" in their names.
    </p><p>
    But few institutions overstayed their welcome like the shopping mall. Our compulsive interest
    with what lay within them was dulled by repetition, and replaced by the dawning sense that what
    lay without — blank walls and acres of naked parking lot — was (and remains) a blight on the
    landscape.
    </p><p>
    So: Bye-bye, Valley View. There's not much left now, apart from the movie theater, which
    Midtown developers say will close by year's end.
    </p><p>
    At least something new will grow in its place, something interesting.
    </p>
